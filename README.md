# 🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System for MANETs 📡

## Project Overview 🚀

Our team is dedicated to developing a cutting-edge Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) tailored specifically for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs). We recognize the unique challenges posed by MANETs, including their dynamic nature and resource constraints. Traditional intrusion detection techniques often fall short in these environments.

## Overview 🌟

Our project revolves around conducting comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain deep insights into the data collected from MANETs. Subsequently, we leverage various machine learning models to detect network intrusions effectively.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

EDA is the cornerstone of our project, where we delve into the dataset collected from MANETs. Through meticulous analysis, we aim to unravel the structure, patterns, and anomalies within the data. This phase is pivotal for feature selection, preprocessing, and identifying potential data issues.

## Machine Learning Models 🤖

We've harnessed the power of several machine learning models to combat network intrusions in MANETs. Our arsenal includes:

- Logistic Regression
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- AdaBoost
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- TensorFlow (Deep Learning)

Each model undergoes rigorous evaluation to ascertain its accuracy on unseen data, thereby determining its effectiveness in detecting intrusions.

## Live Streaming Prediction 📡

To stay ahead of threats in real-time, we've implemented a live streaming prediction system. Leveraging RabbitMQ for message queuing and Streamlit for visualization, our system utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for instantaneous prediction of network intrusions as data streams in.
